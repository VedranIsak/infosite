  I made a small Angular website for Region Östergötland during my internship there. I did not finish the site in time,
  but I managed to deliver a functioning prototype that was then forked by my employeer. The website is aimed for healthcare workers for assessing requirements for patient movement within
  the hospitals and healthcare facilites in which they are located.`, 
  `During my initial stint as a .NET developer I started developing a website aimed at explaining the Yugoslav wars during my free time. The site was made with ASP.NET Core MVC and took a couple of 
  to develop and host. The database architecture was constructed with SQL Server and the website is hosted through....`, 
  `During my last year as a college student, I developed a multithreaded Chat Application with WPF MVVM together with a coursemate. The application
  is as mentioned multithreaded and can be used by two users that share the same network. We divided the work so that I mainly worked on the frontend while 
  my coursemate worked with the thread architecture.`, 
  `The last project I've been working at is this very site. Written with React, where I learned the framework while developing the site.`];

  Starting with learning the Big O notation I then progressed to learning about sorting algorithms such as quicksort, bubblesort and heapsort. 
  I finished off my studies within this field by learning about common data structures used for storage, such as linked lists, binary search trees and AVL trees.`, 
  `I also spent time learning databases, where we specifically studied relational databases with a focus on SQL. We also spent quite a bit of time learning about ER modeling, 
  so called entity-relationship models.`, 
  `I also spent quite a bit of time during my studies on learning the object-oriented programming paradigm. 
  In my coursework we took use of good old Java for achieving this. We learned about classes, objects, instantiation and of course the four fundamental pillars:
  abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.`,
  `I also spent a surprising amount of time learning about agile work and agile principles, doing this actually in several courses. I learned about, 
  and simulated using, daily scrums, sprints etc. By simulating I mean that we created case scenarios in my class, were we then divided ourselves into small groups
  and tried to solve these case scenarios using agile methods.`];
